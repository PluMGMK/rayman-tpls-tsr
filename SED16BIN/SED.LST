   NAME
      sed - the stream editor

   SYNOPSIS
      sed [-d] [-e script] [-f sfilename] [-g] [-I] [-n] [filename ]

   DESCRIPTION
   sed reads each filename line by line, edits each line according to a script
   of commands  as specified  by the  -e and -f arguments  and then copies the
   edited line to the standard output.

   OPTIONS
   The -d option causes debug messages to be written to stdout.  The -e option
   supplies a single edit command from the next argument; if there are several
   of these they are executed in the order in which  they appear.  If there is
   just one -e option  and no -f's, the  -e flag may be omitted.  An -f option
   causes  commands to be taken from the file  sfilename; if there are several
   of these  they are executed  in the order in which they appear;  -e and  -f
   commands may be mixed. The script or sfilename can be adjacent to the -e or
   -f or  can be  the next argument on the command line.  The -g option causes
   sed to act as though every substitute command in the  following script  has
   a  g suffix.  The -I option causes letter comparisons to ignore case. e.g.,
   with -I set,  I and i match  one another,  otherwise  they do not.  The  -n
   option  suppresses the default output.

   SCRIPTS
   A script  consists of  one or  more sed  commands of  the  following  form:
        [address[,address]] function [arguments]     
   Normally sed cyclically copies a line of input into a  current text buffer,
   then applies  in sequence all commands whose addresses select that line and
   then copies  the buffer  to standard  output and clears the buffer.  The -n
   option suppresses normal output so that only commands which do output (e.g.
   p) cause  any writing  to occur.   Also,  some commands (n, N) do their own
   line reads,  and some  others (o, d, D) cause all commands following in the
   script to  be skipped  (the D  command also  suppresses the clearing of the
   current text  buffer that  would normally  occur before  the  next  cycle).
   There is  also a  second buffer (called the 'hold space' that can be copied
   or appended to or from or swapped with the current text buffer.

   ADDRESSES
   An address  is: a  decimal number  (which matches  that numbered line where
   line numbers start at 1 and run cumulatively across files), or a '$' (which
   matches the last line of input), or a '/regular expression/' (which matches
   any line  satisfying the expression. The following rules govern the address
   matching:

      * A command line with no addresses selects every input line.

      * A command line with one address selects every input line that  matches
        that address.

      * A command line with two addresses selects the inclusive range from the
        first input line that matches the first address up to and including
        the next input that matches the second. (If the second address is a

        number less than or equal to the line number first  selected, only one
        line is selected.) Once the second address is matched sed starts
        looking for the first one again; thus, any number of these ranges will
        be matched.

      * The second address may be in the form of '+number'.  This means that
        the command will stay selected for number lines after the first
        address is satisfied.

      * \?regular expression? where ? is any character other than \ is
        identical to /regular expression/.

      * The negation operator '!' preceding a function makes that function
        apply to every line not selected by the address(es).

   FUNCTIONS
   In the  following list  of  functions,  the  maximum  number  of  addresses
   permitted for  each function  is indicated  in parentheses.    An  argument
   denoted 'text' consists of one or more lines,  with all but the last ending
   with '\' to hide the newline. A command with this type argument must be the
   last on  any command  line or  -e argument. Otherwise multiple commands may
   appear on  a line  separated by  ';' characters.   A  command  may  have  a
   trailing comment  indicated by  a '#' character. Comment lines begin with a
   '#'.   Backslashes in  text are  treated as  described in 'escape sequences
   below; they   may  be  used  to  protect  initial  whitespace  against  the
   stripping that  is done  on every  line of the script.  An argument denoted
   'label', 'rfile'  or 'wfile'  (which specify  labels or file names)  is not
   processed for  'escape sequences'.  Therefore a  ';' or  '#' terminates the
   label or  file name. This simplifies entering DOS style paths. Each 'wfile'
   is created  before processing  begins.   There can  be at  most 10 distinct
   'wfile' arguments.

   (1) a text      Append the 'text' on output before reading the next input
                   line.

   (2) b [label]   Branch to the ':' command with the given 'label'.  If no
                   'label' is  given, branch to the end of the script.

   (2) c text      Change lines by deleting the current text buffer and at the
                   end of the address range, place 'text' on the output.
                   Start the next input cycle.

   (2) d           Delete the current text buffer. Start the next input cycle.

   (2) D           Delete the first line of the current text buffer (all
                   characters up to the first newline). Start the next input
                   cycle.

   (2) g           Replace the contents of the current text buffer with the
                   contents  of the hold space.

   (2) G           Append the contents of the hold space to the current text
                   buffer.

   (2) h           Copy the current text buffer into the hold space.

   (2) H           Append a copy of the current text buffer to the hold space.

   (1) i text      Insert the 'text' on the standard output.

   (2) l [w[file]] List current text buffer on standard output or to a file if
                   the  -w option follows. Non ASCII printable characters are
                   expanded as shown in the 'escape sequence' section below.

   (2) n           Copy the current text buffer to standard output. Read the
                   next line of input into it. The current line number
                   changes.

   (2) N           Append the next line of input to the current text buffer,
                   inserting an embedded newline between the two. The current
                   line number changes.

   (2) p           Copy the current text buffer to the standard output.

   (2) P           Copy the first line of the current text buffer (all
                   characters up to the first newline) to standard output.

   (1) q           Quit. Perform any pending outputs (a or r commands) and
                   terminate sed.

   (1) r rfile     Read the contents of 'rfile'. Place them on the output
                   before reading the next input line.

   (2) s /regular expression/replacement/flags
                   Substitute the 'replacement' for instances of the 'regular
                   expression' in the current text buffer.  Any character
                   except '\' may be used instead of '/'.  An empty regular
                   expression is substituted by the last regular expression
                   used. (This is evaluated at run-time.) In the replacement
                   expression' and in the 'replacement' \1 - \9 are used to
                   indicate the nth subexpression indicated by a '\(...\)'
                   expression in the 'regular expression'.  In the replacement
                   text an & may be used to indicate the entire matched
                   expression and the following modifying prefixes may be
                   applied to & and \1 - \9.
                   
                     \l (\u) - convert the next character to lowercase 
                               (uppercase) if uppercase (lowercase).

                     \L (\U) - convert uppercase (lowercase) characters to
                               lowercase (uppercase) until /e or /E or the
                               end of the replacement string is encountered.

                   In the replacement, $0 means the original line, $i (i=1..9)
                   means word i.  If there are less than i words then $i is an
                   empty string.  Words have the same meaning as in \< and \>.

                   '\\~', a copy of the replacement from the previous s

                   command is used as the replacement for this command.  Note,
                   an earlier version of sed used '%' for this purpose.  '~'
                   would be preferred as it is used for this in the ex editor.
                   However, that breaks Greg Ubben's masterly dc.sed and it
                   would not be reasonable to do so. '\~' is used for this in
                   ex when the magic option is not set. The extra '\' is
                   needed to fight through slash doubling.

                   'Flags' are any of the following options, with the following
                   provisos: if present w must be the last one; only the last
                   of either p or P is used; and only the last 'n' is used.

                     g - Global. Substitute for all nonoverlapping instances
                       of the  'RE' rather than just the first one.

                     I - (Yes, it is a capital). Use case insensitive matching
                       when comparing letters in the regular expression with
                       letters in the current text buffer.

                     n - Where n can be 1 through 2048. Perform only the nth
                       replacement. If  g is also set or the -g option is
                       selected, this option means that the nth and all
                       succeeding substitutions are performed.

                     p - Print the current text buffer if a replacement is made.

                     P - Print the first line of the current text buffer if a
                       replacement is made.
                     w[wfile] -  Append the current text buffer to the file
                       argument as in a w command if a replacement is made.
                       Standard output is used if no file argument is given.

   (2) t [label]   Branch to the ':' command with the given 'label' if any  s
                   commands made any substitutions since the most recent read
                   of an input line or execution of a t or  T.  If no 'label'
                   is given, branch to the end of the script.

   (2) T [label]   Branch to the ':' command with the given 'label' if no s
                   commands have succeeded since the last input line or t or T
                   command. Branch to the end of the script if no 'label' is
                   given.

   (2) w [wfile]   Write the current text buffer to 'wfile'. If no 'wfile' is
                   given standard output is used.

   (2) W [wfile]   Write the first line of the current text buffer to 'wfile'.
                   If no 'wfile' is given standard output is used.

   (2) x           Exchange the contents of the current text buffer and hold
                   space.

   (2) y /string1/string2/
                   Translate. Replace each occurrence of a character in
                   string1 with the corresponding character in string2.  The
                   '/' may be any character not in 'string1' or 'string2'.
                   The lengths of the two strings must be equal.

   ESCAPE SEQUENCES    
   The following escape sequences are used to represent unprintable characters
   in 'text',  'regular expressions'  and 'replacement' text. It is ignored in
   'labels' and 'file's.  If the character following the '\ 'is not list below
   the '\'  causes the  character to  be quoted  during script  input.  The  l
   command also uses this convention.

             \a   - bell       (ASCII 07)  
             \b   - backspace  (ASCII 08)  
             \e   - escape     (ASCII 27)  
             \f   - formfeed   (ASCII 12)  
             \n   - newline    (ASCII 10)  
             \r   - return     (ASCII 13)  
             \t   - tab        (ASCII 09)  
             \v   - verticaltab(ASCII 11)  
             \xhh - the ASCII character corresponding to 2 hex digits hh.     
             \\   - the backslash itself.  

   REGULAR EXPRESSIONS ('REs')   
   Regular expressions  can be  built up from the following "single-character"
   'RE's:

   c         Any ordinary character not listed below. An ordinary character
             matches itself.

   \          Backslash. When followed by a special character the 'RE' matches
             the "quoted character" as listed in 'Escape Sequences' above.  A
             backslash followed by one of <,>,(,),{,} or 0...9 represents an
             'operator' in a regular expression, as described below.

   .         Dot. Matches any single character except the NEWLINE at the end
             of a line.

   ^         Caret. As the leftmost character in an 'RE' this constrains the
             pattern to be an anchored match.  That is it must match anchored
             at the first character in the line.  In any other position the ^
             is an ordinary character.

   SED(1)                      USER DOCUMENTATION                       SED(1)


   $         The dollar sign as the rightmost character in an 'RE' matches the
             NEWLINE at the end of the line. At any other position the $ is an
             ordinary character.

   ^RE$      This requires the 'RE' to match the entire buffer.

   [c...]    A nonempty string of characters enclosed by square brackets
             matches any single character in the string except the NEWLINE at
             the end of the string.  If the first character of the string is a
             caret (^), then the 'RE' matches any character not in the string
             except the NEWLINE at the end of the string. A '-' sign may be
             used to express ranges of characters. For example the range '[0-
             9]' is equivalent to the string '[0123456789]'. The '-' is
             treated as an ordinary character if it occurs in the string at a
             position that can not be part of a range. This construct is
             called 'set definition'.

   \{m\}
   \{m,\}
   \{m,n\\}  When any of these constructs follow an ordinary character, a dot,
             a 'set  definition' or the '\n' construct. This construct matches
             the previous construct  for a range of occurrences.  At least  m
             occurrences will be matched and at most  n.  "\{m,\}" matches at
             least m occurrences and "\{m}" matches exactly m. m and n are
             numbers between 0 and 255 inclusive and m must not exceed n.

   *         When this follows an ordinary character, a dot, a 'set
             definition' or the '\n' construct, this 'RE' matches 0 or more
             occurrences of that construct. This pattern is called a
             'closure'.

   +         This pattern is similar to the star above but matches one or more
             occurrences of the previous construct.

   \<        The sequence \< in an 'RE' requires that the scan position in the
             line must be immediately following a character that can not be
             part  of a "word" and immediately preceding a character that can
             be part of a "word".  In this context a "word" is any sequence of
             upper and lowercase letters, a numeral [0-9] or the underscore
             character (_).

   \>        The sequence \> in an 'RE' requires that the scan position in the
             line must be immediately following a character that can be part
             of a "word" and immediately preceding a character that can not be
             part of a "word".

   \(...\)   An 'RE' enclosed between the character sequences \( and \)
             matches whatever the unadorned 'RE' matches, but saves the string
             matched by the enclosed RE in a numbered substring register.
             There can be up to nine such substrings in an 'RE', and the
             parenthesis operators can be nested.

   \n        Match the contents on the nth substring register. When nested
             substrings are present, 'n' is determined by counting the
             occurrences of \( starting from the left.

   sed: too many addresses in 'command' -- The = a i q and r commands
        allow only one address. The } command allows none.

   sed: too many commands, last was 'command' -- More than 200 commands met.

   During the actual editing the following fatal errors can occur:

   sed: append too long after line 'number' -- An A, G, H, or N command
        created a line in the buffer longer than 8192 characters

   sed: bad command code 'number' -- Internal error in sed program.
   
   sed: bad RE code 'number' -- Internal error in sed program.

   sed: decode buffer overflow -- A command could not be handled by -d option.

   sed: infinite branch loop at line 'number' -- More than 50 branches were
        taken without the editing of the line completing. (Compiled out.)

   sed: line too long at line 'number' -- While the s command was performing a

   sed: old RE not set -- An empty RE was given ta o substitute command when
        no previous RE was available. This rarely happens and requires skill
        to make it happen. 'garbled command' during compilation is more likely.
        Scenario to reproduce: -e blab1 -e s//fails/ ... We can't detect this
        scenario at compile time as we need to allow
        -e blab1 -e :lab2 -e s//best/;q -e :lab1 -e s/good/better/ -e blab2

   sed: RE bad code 'code' -- An internal processing error has occurred while
        matching a 'regular expression'

   sed: too many appends or reads after line 'number' -- An append or read
        command caused more than 20 appends and reads for the given line

   sed: zero byte matching RE -- Regular expressions such as the following
        give an infinite number of matches: -e "s/\<//g"; -e s/[char-set]*//g.

   BUGS

   I tried  to fix  every problem  I could find, but I believe the follow bugs
   still exist in this version:

      * Duplicated subexpressions are deeply flawed. e.g. \([a-z][a-z]\)*
        against abcdefg matches abcdef and sets \n as fg but does not match
        nothing before 1 in 123 and set \n to nothing as it should.

   COMPATIBILITY
   This version of sed is a modification of the Internet supplied GNU version.
   That version  was reverse-engineered  from BSD  4.1 UNIX sed. The following
   changes, modifications and improvements have been made:

      * There is no hidden length limit (40 in BSD sed) on 'wfile' names.

      * There is no limit (8 in BSD sed) on the length of 'labels'.

      * The exchange command works for long pattern and hold spaces.

      * 'Escape sequences' are inhibited for both 'label's and 'filename's.

      * All commands not having a 'text' argument can be separated by ";" or
        can have trailing comments (#)

      * a, c and i commands don't insist on a leading backslash  '\n' in the
        text.

      * r and w commands do not insist on whitespace before the filename.

      * The g, P, p and 'n' options on s commands may be given in any order.

      * Escape sequences are valid in all contexts except file names and
        labels.

      * The full range of characters are allowed. 255 values. Not NUL (0)

      * In an 'RE', '+' calls for 1...n repeats of the previous pattern.

   SED(1)                      USER DOCUMENTATION                       SED(1)


      * The l command produces a hex format rather than octal in the UNIX sed.

      * The W command (write first line of pattern space to file).

      * The T command (branch on last substitution failed).

      * sed's error messages are more specific and informative and halt sed.

      * + allowed in the second address.

      * The empty RE "//" is allowed as a first address if a previous RE has
        been compiled

      * The -e and -f command line options do not require their arguments to
        be separate options.

      * If no arguments are given sed prints usage data.

      * In all contexts a blank file name means 'stdout'.

      * The -d option demonstrates the operation of a sed command.

      * Case insensitivity provided globally with the -I option and locally
        with an I flag in gerular expression addresses and on the substitute
        command.

      * The substitute command sets $0 to the contents of the text buffer
        before the command and $1..$9 to the first 9 words of that buffer.

   This version  otherwise appears to be equivalent to the UNIX version on the
   Sun4 computer.   That  is I  believe anything  that sed did on that system,
   this version of sed will do the same on either a Sun4 or a PC under DOS. If
   anyone can really explain what sed is really supposed to do as explained in
   the UNIX documentation I would appreciate the information.  The manual page
   refers to  ed for  further details  which is  ambiguous  at  best.

   I have made very little change to this document. I have made more change to
   the program. As well as culling bugs, I have added the -d and -i options,
   the I qualifier to regular expression addresses and to the s command, 
   /[ELUelu] qualifiers to back-references, and $n to substitute commands.

   I would appreciate any comments, suggestions and even bug reports.  I some-
   times can  be reached on INTERNET (the fiscal year is almost over), but you
   can always contact me by mail or phone
